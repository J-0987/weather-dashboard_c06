# Jasmine's Blog

## Description
For this challenge, I created a two-page website where users will input and view blog posts. It includes building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle. It isn't the prettiest, but it works. Pretty takes time and experience. I continue to preservere.
